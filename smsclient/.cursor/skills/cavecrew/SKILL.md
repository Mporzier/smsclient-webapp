  Decision guide for delegating to caveman-style subagents. Tells the main
  thread WHEN to spawn `cavecrew-investigator` (locate code), `cavecrew-builder`
  (1-2 file edit), or `cavecrew-reviewer` (diff review) instead of doing the
  work inline or using vanilla `Explore`. Subagent output is caveman-compressed
  so the tool-result injected back into main context is ~60% smaller — main
  context lasts longer across long sessions.
  Trigger: "delegate to subagent", "use cavecrew", "spawn investigator/builder/reviewer",
  "save context", "compressed agent output".

Cavecrew = three subagent presets that emit caveman output. Same job as Anthropic defaults (`Explore`, edit-style agents, reviewer); difference is the tool-result they return is compressed, so main context shrinks per delegation.

## When to use cavecrew vs alternatives

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| "Where is X defined / what calls Y / list uses of Z" | `cavecrew-investigator` |
| Same but you also want suggestions/architecture commentary | `Explore` (vanilla) |
| Surgical edit, ≤2 files, scope obvious | `cavecrew-builder` |
| New feature / 3+ files / cross-cutting refactor | Main thread or `feature-dev:code-architect` |
| Review diff, branch, or file for bugs | `cavecrew-reviewer` |
| Deep code review with rationale + alternatives | `Code Reviewer` (vanilla) |
| One-line answer you already know | Main thread, no subagent |

Rule of thumb: **if you'd want the subagent's output in 1/3 the tokens, pick cavecrew. If you'd want prose, pick vanilla.**

## Output contracts

**`cavecrew-investigator`**
```
<Header>:
- path:line — `symbol` — short note
totals: <counts>.
```
Or `No match.`

**`cavecrew-builder`**
```
<path:line-range> — <change ≤10 words>.
verified: <re-read OK | mismatch @ path:line>.
```
Or one of: `too-big.` / `needs-confirm.` / `ambiguous.` / `regressed.`

**`cavecrew-reviewer`**
```
path:line: <emoji> <severity>: <problem>. <fix>.
totals: N🔴 N🟡 N🔵 N❓
```
Or `No issues.`

## Chaining

Locate → fix → verify: investigator → builder → reviewer.

Single-shot edit when path:line already known: skip investigator.

## What NOT to do

- Don't use builder without known file — investigator first.
- Don't chain builder for 5-file refactor — returns `too-big.`
- Don't expect prose from reviewer — findings only.
